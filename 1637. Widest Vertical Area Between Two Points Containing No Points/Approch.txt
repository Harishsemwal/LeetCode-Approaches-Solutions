Hint
Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3

Solution: We have the input here: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
so take the only horizontal points like: [8, 9, 7, 9]
then sort these points : [7, 8, 9, 9]
now find the difference: [1, 1, 0] ----> nums[i] - nums[i-1]
then Find the maximum values [1, 1, 0] = 1
So the Output is : 1

Second Input:  [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Extract horizontal points: [3, 9, 1, 1, 5, 8]
Sort the horizontal points: [1, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9]
Find the differences between consecutive points: [0, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Find the maximum difference: 3
Therefore, the output for the given input is 3.
